The Crime Reporting System is a web-based platform developed using PHP and MySQL, designed to facilitate the reporting of crimes by citizens and the management of these reports by law enforcement officers. This system aims to provide a seamless and efficient process for reporting and addressing criminal incidents.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** The system offers secure user authentication for both citizens and law enforcement officers. Registered users can log in to submit and manage crime reports.

- **Report Submission:** Citizens can create and submit detailed crime reports, including information such as incident description, location, date, and any relevant evidence.

- **Officer Access:** Law enforcement officers can log in using their credentials and access a dashboard where they can view, prioritize, and manage incoming crime reports.

- **Report Status Updates:** Officers have the ability to update the status of a reported crime, such as "Under Investigation," "Resolved," or "Closed," providing transparency to citizens about the progress of their reports.

- **Search and Filters:** The system includes search and filtering functionality to allow officers to quickly find and manage specific reports based on various criteria.

- **Notifications:** Automated email notifications can be sent to citizens to acknowledge their report submission and provide updates on the status of their reports.

- **Dashboard:** Both citizens and officers have personalized dashboards with relevant information and actions based on their roles.

- **Data Visualization:** The system can potentially include visualizations such as charts and graphs to provide insights into crime trends and patterns.
